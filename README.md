React project created as a mock search engine with TS and SCSS

This project works with a mock data created to serve as company worker search database. 

The aim of the project was to sharpen my styling by creating a carousel and a pagination by myself along with a working search engine. 

P.S: Rhona Mooney is the name to search for full access to pagination in the search page.
